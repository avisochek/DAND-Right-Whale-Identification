## We require a second round of annotations that are capable of taking into account the rotational orientation of each whale. 

##In order to do this, within this directory, follow the instructions outlined in the original ImageAnnotations directory, only instead of a rectangle, you will draw two points, one just outside the tip of the whale's head, and the other just past the blowholes.

##Use the following images for reference:
