## First Whale Identifier...

## This code contains the first attempt at a whale identifier

1. Run image_parser.py from within this directory to generate data file for 
training images (requires pillow and all annotation steps to be complete)

2. Upload keras_1.py and output file from previous step to aws if necessary. Indicate path to data file within keras_1.py

3. Run keras_1.py on aws server or a computer with a good GPU and cuda installed (requires cuda, keras, and bleeding edge theano)

4. Results from previous step indicate the approximate performance of the algorithm as tested on a subset of the training images.
